# @gephi/gephi-lite-sdk

The package [@gephi/gephi-lite-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gephi/gephi-lite-sdk) contains various TypeScript typings and utils for [Gephi Lite](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite).

> [!WARNING]
> Use this carefully!
> It is not stable, as for now, its main purpose was to make typings available outside Gephi Lite to allow to develop [@gephi/gephi-lite-broadcast](../broadcast).
> Its scope and functional boundaries (what should be in and out) is still to be determined.
